## Prompt

/sp.plan create an architectural plan

## Response snapshot

Successfully created the implementation plan for 'Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain Content', including research, data model, and quickstart documentation. The plan is ready for the next phase.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created a detailed implementation plan for generating Module 3 content.
- 🧪 Tests: Constitution checks passed before and after design phases.
- 📁 Files: Created `plan.md`, `research.md`, `data-model.md`, `quickstart.md`, and `contracts/` directory.
- 🔁 Next prompts: User can proceed with `/sp.tasks` to break down the implementation into actionable tasks.
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully integrated research phase to resolve technical clarifications and documented the data model for content structure.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None observed during planning process.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): null
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): null
