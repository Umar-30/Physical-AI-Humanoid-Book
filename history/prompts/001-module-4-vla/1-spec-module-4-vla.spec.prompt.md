surface: agent
model: gemini-1.5-flash

  email: user@example.com
command: /sp.specify You are an expert at the intersection of Large Language Models, robotics, and edge AI systems. Your task is to write the complete, detailed instructional content for **Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)**, broken down into its four chapters as specified, culminating in the Capstone Project. For **each chapter and its subsections**, please provide: 1. **Detailed Step-by-Step Instructions:** Assume the student has a Jetson Orin kit and a powerful workstation from previous modules. Provide concrete, copy-pasteable code. * **Chapter 1:** Provide the Python code for the `voice_input_node` using `faster-whisper`, including audio stream handling and ROS 2 topic publishing. * **Chapter 2:** Provide example prompts for GPT-4 and Claude to generate ROS action sequences. Also, provide code for a local planner node using the `llama_cpp` Python library with a quantized model. * **Chapter 3:** Provide a snippet for a ROS action server `scan_for_object` that calls a Grounding DINO-based inference service. * **Chapter 4:** Provide a state machine diagram (as pseudocode or Mermaid JS) for the Orchestrator Node and the master launch file that brings up the entire system. 2. **Clear Explanations of Complex Concepts:** Make advanced topics accessible. * Explain the "tool-use" paradigm for LLMs in robotics with analogies. * Contrast open-vocabulary detection with traditional fixed-class detection. * Discuss the critical trade-offs between cloud vs. local LLMs in terms of latency, cost, and reliability for a moving robot. 3. **System Architecture Diagrams:** Describe the necessary diagrams. * A comprehensive data flow diagram showing the journey from audio signal to joint command, highlighting all ROS topics, nodes, and external services (Whisper, LLM API). * A diagram of the Orchestrator Node's finite state machine. 4. **Troubleshooting & Optimization Guide:** Address real-world issues. * **Chapter 1:** Whisper mishears commands in noisy environments; audio stream latency. * **Chapter 2:** LLM generates invalid or unsafe plans; API timeouts or high costs. * **Chapter 3:** Open-vocabulary detector is slow on Jetson or fails on ambiguous descriptions. * **Chapter 4:** The pipeline works in isolation but breaks in integration; race conditions or timing issues. 5. **Chapter Project/Checkpoint:** Define a clear, testable milestone for each chapter that students must demo (e.g., for Chapter 2: "Show a terminal log where your planner node receives the text 'wave your right hand' and outputs a valid ROS 2 action sequence."). **Structure your output exactly as follows:** ### Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) #### Chapter 1: Voice as the Primary Interface (Voice-to-Action) *(Proceed with subsections 1.1, 1.2, 1.3)* #### Chapter 2: Language as a Planning Tool (Cognitive Planning) *(Proceed with subsections 2.1, 2.2, 2.3)* #### Chapter 3: Grounding Language in Vision (Vision-Language Integration) *(Proceed with subsections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3)* #### Chapter 4: The Autonomous Humanoid Capstone Integration *(Proceed with subsections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4)* **Tone:** Be insightful and forward-thinking. Write for students who are now proficient roboticists and are ready to integrate the most cutting-edge AI technologies to build truly intelligent behavior. Emphasize the "why" behind architectural choices.
