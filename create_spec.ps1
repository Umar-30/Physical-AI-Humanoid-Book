Your task is to guide the development of a “Digital Twin” simulation for a humanoid robotics lab as part of a course module. Please provide: 1. **Step-by-step instructions** to: - Model a simple humanoid robot (biped with arms, head, and torso) in URDF format, including simulated RGB-D camera, LiDAR, and IMU sensors. - Build a lab environment in Gazebo (with walls, floor, obstacles, and lighting) and export it for use in Unity. - Set up the ROS 2–Unity bridge to transfer robot poses and sensor data between Gazebo/ROS 2 and Unity. 2. **Code snippets** for: - A URDF snippet for an RGB-D camera (RealSense D435i) and a 3D LiDAR. - A Gazebo world file (SDF) with basic physics properties and environment geometry. - A Unity C# script to subscribe to ROS 2 topic `/cmd_vel` and move a robot model. 3. **Troubleshooting tips** for common issues: - Time synchronization between Gazebo and Unity. - Noisy or missing sensor data in simulation. - Physics misbehavior (e.g., robot falling through floor) in Gazebo. 4. **Best practices** for: - Keeping Gazebo and Unity environments consistent (scale, coordinates, units). - Simulating realistic sensor noise and calibration parameters. - Optimizing performance for real-time simulation. 5. **Recommended extensions** for advanced learners: - Adding a human avatar in Unity for human-robot interaction practice. - Using NVIDIA Isaac Sim for generating synthetic training data from the Unity environment. Please structure the answer clearly with headings, code blocks, and bullet points for readability. Assume the user has Ubuntu 22.04, ROS 2 Humble, Gazebo Fortress, and Unity 2022 LTS installed."
