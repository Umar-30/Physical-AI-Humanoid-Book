# Module 2 Glossary

## Key Terms and Concepts

### Simulation & Physics

**Digital Twin**
: A virtual replica of a physical robot that accurately mimics its behavior, physics, and sensor responses in simulation. Enables safe testing and development without physical hardware.

**Physics Engine**
: Software that computes the motion, collisions, and forces acting on objects in a simulated environment. Examples: Bullet, DART, ODE.

**Real-Time Factor**
: The ratio of simulation time to wall-clock time. A factor of 1.0 means simulation runs at real-time speed; 0.5 means half-speed; 2.0 means twice as fast.

**Timestep (dt)**
: The fixed time interval between physics updates in simulation, typically 0.001-0.002 seconds (1-2ms). Smaller timesteps improve accuracy but reduce performance.

**Collision Detection**
: The process of determining when two objects in simulation come into contact, triggering appropriate physical responses.

### File Formats

**SDF (Simulation Description Format)**
: XML-based format used by Gazebo to describe worlds, models, lights, and physics. Extension: `.sdf`

**URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)**
: XML-based format describing robot structure (links, joints), visual appearance, collision geometries, and physical properties. Extension: `.urdf`

**XACRO**
: XML Macro language that extends URDF with variables, conditionals, and macros for more maintainable robot descriptions. Extension: `.xacro`

### Robot Structure

**Link**
: A rigid body component of a robot (e.g., torso, thigh, foot). Contains visual, collision, and inertial properties.

**Joint**
: A connection between two links that defines their relative motion. Types include revolute (rotational), prismatic (sliding), fixed, and continuous.

**Inertia Tensor**
: A 3x3 matrix describing how mass is distributed in a link, determining its rotational behavior. Components: Ixx, Iyy, Izz (diagonal), Ixy, Ixz, Iyz (off-diagonal).

**Collision Geometry**
: Simplified shapes (boxes, spheres, cylinders, meshes) used for fast collision detection, typically simpler than visual meshes.

**Degrees of Freedom (DOF)**
: The number of independent parameters defining a robot's configuration. A humanoid might have 20-30 DOF (one per joint).

### Sensors

**IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)**
: Sensor measuring linear acceleration and angular velocity. Essential for robot orientation and balance.

**Lidar (Light Detection and Ranging)**
: Sensor that uses laser pulses to measure distances to surrounding objects, creating a 2D or 3D point cloud.

**RGB-D Camera**
: Camera providing both color (RGB) images and depth information for each pixel.

**Force-Torque Sensor**
: Measures forces and torques applied at a specific location, often placed in robot feet or wrists.

### ROS 2 Concepts

**Topic**
: A named communication channel in ROS 2 where nodes publish and subscribe to messages. Example: `/joint_states`

**Node**
: An independent process in ROS 2 that performs computation, publishes, and/or subscribes to topics.

**Message**
: Structured data sent over ROS 2 topics. Examples: `sensor_msgs/JointState`, `geometry_msgs/Pose`

**TF (Transform)**
: ROS 2 system for tracking coordinate frame relationships over time, enabling spatial transformations between robot links.

**DDS (Data Distribution Service)**
: The middleware standard underlying ROS 2, enabling decentralized peer-to-peer communication.

### Gazebo Architecture

**Entity-Component-System (ECS)**
: Gazebo Harmonic's architectural pattern where entities (robots, objects) have components (physics, sensors) managed by systems (solvers, rendering).

**Plugin**
: Dynamically loaded C++ library that extends Gazebo functionality, such as custom sensors or actuators.

**World**
: The complete simulation environment including models, lighting, physics configuration, and environment settings.

### Unity Integration

**TCP/IP Bridge**
: Network connection between ROS 2 (running ros_tcp_endpoint) and Unity (using ROS-TCP-Connector), enabling message exchange.

**ArticulationBody**
: Unity physics component representing a robot joint, used to synchronize with ROS 2 joint states.

**ROS-TCP-Connector**
: Unity package enabling ROS 2 topic subscription and publication via TCP/IP.

**URDF Importer**
: Unity tool that converts URDF robot models into Unity GameObject hierarchies with ArticulationBodies.

### Performance Metrics

**Hz (Hertz)**
: Update frequency, measured in cycles per second. Physics: 100-1000 Hz, rendering: 30-60 Hz.

**FPS (Frames Per Second)**
: Number of rendered frames per second in Unity or Gazebo visualization.

**Latency**
: Time delay between an event occurring in Gazebo and being displayed in Unity, target: &lt;100ms.

**Bandwidth**
: Network data transfer rate between simulators, measured in Mbps (megabits per second).

### Physics Properties

**Mass**
: The quantity of matter in a link, measured in kilograms (kg). Affects inertia and response to forces.

**Friction (μ)**
: Resistance to motion between surfaces. Two types: static (μs) and kinetic/dynamic (μk).

**Damping**
: Energy dissipation in joints that opposes motion, preventing oscillations. Units: Ns/m (linear) or Nms/rad (angular).

**Elasticity / Restitution**
: How "bouncy" a collision is, ranging from 0 (perfectly inelastic) to 1 (perfectly elastic).

**Gravity**
: Acceleration due to Earth's gravitational field, typically -9.81 m/s² in the Z-axis (downward).
