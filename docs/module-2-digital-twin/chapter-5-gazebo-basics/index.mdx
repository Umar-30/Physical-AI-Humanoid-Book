# Chapter 5: Gazebo Physics, Worlds, and Robot Spawning

## Chapter Overview

Welcome to Chapter 5! This is your **foundation chapter** for simulation-based robotics. By the end of this chapter, you'll be able to create realistic simulation environments and spawn humanoid robots in Gazebo Harmonic.

:::tip Priority 1 - Foundation
This chapter is marked **P1 (Priority 1)** because everything else in Module 2 builds on these skills. Master this chapter before moving forward!
:::

## What You'll Learn

By completing this chapter, you will be able to:

1. ✅ **Install** Gazebo Harmonic on Ubuntu 22.04 and verify installation
2. ✅ **Create** SDF world files with ground planes, lighting, and physics configuration
3. ✅ **Spawn** humanoid robot URDF models using both command-line and launch files
4. ✅ **Configure** physics engine parameters (timestep, solvers, gravity)
5. ✅ **Troubleshoot** common Gazebo installation and runtime issues

## Prerequisites

Before starting this chapter, ensure you have:

- ✅ **Module 1 Completed**: Understanding of ROS 2 basics and URDF fundamentals
- ✅ **Ubuntu 22.04**: Installed either natively or via WSL2 on Windows
- ✅ **Hardware**: 16GB RAM, 4GB free disk space, GPU with OpenGL 3.3+
- ✅ **ROS 2 Humble**: Installed and working (verify with `ros2 --version`)

## Key Concepts Preview

:::info What is Gazebo?
**Gazebo** is an open-source robotics simulator that provides:
- **Accurate Physics**: Realistic dynamics, collisions, and forces
- **Sensor Simulation**: Cameras, lidar, IMU, force-torque sensors
- **3D Visualization**: Real-time rendering of robots and environments
- **ROS 2 Integration**: Native support for ROS 2 topics and services

### Gazebo Harmonic vs Classic

This chapter uses **Gazebo Harmonic** (the modern version), NOT Gazebo Classic:

| Feature | Gazebo Classic | Gazebo Harmonic |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|
| Architecture | Monolithic | Component-based (ECS) |
| ROS 2 Support | Via bridge | Native |
| Performance | Good | Excellent |
| Maintenance | Entering EOL | Active development |
| Our Choice | ❌ | ✅ |

## What You'll Build

By the end of this chapter, you'll have created:

1. **Three SDF World Files**:
   - Minimal world (bare bones)
   - Humanoid world (optimized for bipedal robots)
   - Complex world (with obstacles)

2. **Launch Files**:
   - Command-line spawning scripts
   - ROS 2 launch file for automated setup

3. **Working Simulation**:
   - Humanoid robot standing in Gazebo
   - Physics running at 100+ Hz
   - Ready for Chapter 6 enhancements

## Common Questions

<details>
<summary><strong>Q: Can I use Gazebo Classic instead?</strong></summary>

While possible, we **strongly recommend Gazebo Harmonic** because:
- Better ROS 2 integration
- Superior performance for humanoid robots
- Active development and support
- All examples in this book use Harmonic

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Q: Will this work on Windows?</strong></summary>

**Partial support**. Recommended approach:
1. Install WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
2. Install Ubuntu 22.04 in WSL2
3. Follow Linux instructions
4. Use VcXsrv or X410 for GUI display

Native Windows support for Gazebo is limited.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Q: My computer doesn't have a dedicated GPU. Will it work?</strong></summary>

Yes, but with limitations:
- Gazebo will run in **headless mode** (no GUI)
- Physics simulation still works
- Use Unity (Chapter 7) for visualization instead
- Performance may be lower (50-100 Hz vs 100-500 Hz)

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Q: How long does installation take?</strong></summary>

Typical installation time:
- Fast internet: 10-15 minutes
- Slow internet: 30-45 minutes
- Total package size: ~2GB
