# 5.6: Hands-On Exercises

## Overview

Apply what you've learned in Chapter 5 with these practical exercises.

**Target Time**: 30 minutes total
**Difficulty**: Beginner to Intermediate

:::tip Success Criteria
You've mastered Chapter 5 when you can complete all 3 exercises within 30 minutes!

## Exercise 5.1: Create Custom World

**Objective**: Create a world file from scratch with specific requirements

**Requirements**:
1. Name the world `my_custom_world`
2. Use Bullet physics with 1ms timestep
3. Include a ground plane with high friction (μ=1.0)
4. Add 2 static obstacles (your choice of shapes)
5. Configure 2 light sources (1 directional, 1 point)
6. Set background color to light blue (0.7 0.8 0.9)

**Steps**:
1. Copy `minimal_world.sdf` as starting template
2. Modify as per requirements above
3. Save as `my_custom_world.sdf`
4. Test: `gz sim my_custom_world.sdf`

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ World launches without errors
- ✅ Ground and obstacles visible
- ✅ Good lighting (no dark areas)
- ✅ Background is light blue

<details>
<summary><strong>💡 Hints</strong></summary>

- For high friction: Add `<surface><friction><ode><mu>1.0</mu>...` to ground plane
- For obstacles: Copy `<model>` blocks from `complex_world.sdf`
- For point light: Use `<light type="point">` with `<pose>x y z ...</pose>`
- Background: Add `<scene><background>R G B A</background></scene>`

## Exercise 5.2: Spawn Robot at Different Positions

**Objective**: Practice command-line robot spawning at various positions

**Tasks**:
1. Start Gazebo with `humanoid_world.sdf`
2. Spawn robot at origin (0, 0, 1.0)
3. Spawn second robot at (2, 0, 1.0) - name it `robot_2`
4. Spawn third robot at (-2, 0, 1.0) - name it `robot_3`
5. Verify all 3 robots are visible and standing

**Command Template**:
```bash
gz service -s /world/humanoid_world/create \
  --reqtype gz.msgs.EntityFactory \
  --reptype gz.msgs.Boolean \
  --timeout 1000 \
  --req 'sdf_filename: "PATH_TO_URDF", name: "ROBOT_NAME", pose: {position: {x: X, y: Y, z: Z}}'
```

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ All 3 robots spawned successfully
- ✅ Robots have different names
- ✅ Robots positioned correctly (2m apart)
- ✅ All robots standing (not fallen)

<details>
<summary><strong>💡 Hints</strong></summary>

- Use absolute path to `example_humanoid.urdf`
- Each spawn must have unique `name` parameter
- Keep `z: 1.0` to spawn above ground (prevents collision)
- Wait 2-3 seconds between spawns for stability

</details>

## Exercise 5.3: Optimize Physics for Performance

**Objective**: Modify physics settings and measure performance impact

**Tasks**:
1. Create 3 versions of `humanoid_world.sdf`:
   - `world_fast.sdf`: timestep 0.002 (500 Hz)
   - `world_balanced.sdf`: timestep 0.001 (1000 Hz)
   - `world_accurate.sdf`: timestep 0.0005 (2000 Hz)
2. Spawn robot in each world
3. Measure real-time factor for each
4. Document observations

**Measurement Command**:
```bash
gz topic -e -t /stats | grep real_time_factor
```

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ 3 world files created with correct timesteps
- ✅ Measured real-time factor for each
- ✅ Can explain trade-offs (speed vs accuracy)

**Observation Template**:
```
Configuration      | Timestep | Real-Time Factor | Stability | Notes
-------------------|----------|------------------|-----------|-------
Fast (500 Hz)      | 0.002    | ___             | ___       | ___
Balanced (1000 Hz) | 0.001    | ___             | ___       | ___
Accurate (2000 Hz) | 0.0005   | ___             | ___       | ___
```

<details>
<summary><strong>💡 Hints</strong></summary>

- Copy `humanoid_world.sdf` 3 times
- Only change `<max_step_size>` value
- Real-time factor ~1.0 = good performance
- Real-time factor `<0.5` = simulation too slow for hardware

## Bonus Challenge (Optional)

**Create a Launch File**

**Objective**: Automate Exercise 5.2 using a ROS 2 launch file

**Requirements**:
- Launch Gazebo with your custom world
- Spawn 3 robots automatically at different positions
- Add parameters for robot names and positions

**Starting Point**: Use `spawn_robot.launch.py` as template
