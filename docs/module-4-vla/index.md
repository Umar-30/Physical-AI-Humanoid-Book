# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

Welcome to Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)! This module is designed for advanced robotics students ready to integrate cutting-edge AI technologies into humanoid robots. We will explore how to enable robots to understand voice commands, plan complex actions using large language models, perceive their environment through vision-language models, and ultimately execute intelligent behaviors.

This module is structured into four chapters:

*   **Chapter 1: Voice as the Primary Interface**: Learn to process audio input into text commands for robot control using `faster-whisper` and ROS 2.
*   **Chapter 2: Language as a Planning Tool**: Dive into using Large Language Models (LLMs) to translate natural language commands into sequences of robotic actions.
*   **Chapter 3: Grounding Language in Vision**: Integrate visual perception with language understanding to enable robots to identify and interact with objects based on natural language descriptions.
*   **Chapter 4: The Autonomous Humanoid Capstone Integration**: Combine all learned concepts and implementations into a comprehensive capstone project, demonstrating a fully autonomous humanoid robot responding to voice commands.

Throughout this module, you will gain hands-on experience with Python, ROS 2, and various AI frameworks. We will provide detailed step-by-step instructions, practical code examples, in-depth explanations of complex concepts, system architecture diagrams, and troubleshooting guides to ensure a robust learning experience. Each chapter culminates in a project or checkpoint to solidify your understanding and practical skills.
