# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Welcome to Module 1! This module introduces you to **ROS 2** (Robot Operating System 2), the middleware layer that serves as the nervous system of modern robots.

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

1. **Explain** ROS 2 architecture and the role of middleware in robotics systems
2. **Design** robot communication patterns using topics, services, and actions
3. **Implement** Python robot agents with rclpy (ROS 2 Python client library)
4. **Define** humanoid robot structures using URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)

## 📚 Module Structure

This module consists of 4 comprehensive chapters:

### Chapter 1: ROS 2 Architecture & Philosophy
Learn what ROS 2 is, why it exists, and how it solves the complexity of robot communication.

- The role of middleware in robotics
- ROS 2 layered architecture
- ROS 1 vs ROS 2 comparison
- DDS middleware layer
- Getting started with ROS 2

### Chapter 2: Communication Primitives
Master the three primary communication patterns in ROS 2 and learn how to design effective robot systems.

- Topics (publish/subscribe pattern)
- Services (request/response pattern)
- Actions (goal-oriented pattern)
- Quality of Service (QoS) configuration
- Computation graph design

### Chapter 3: Python Implementation with rclpy
Build actual robot agents using Python and the rclpy client library.

- Creating ROS 2 Python packages
- Implementing publishers and subscribers
- Creating services and service clients
- Implementing actions
- Custom message types
- Multi-node systems

### Chapter 4: URDF for Humanoid Robots
Define the physical structure of a humanoid robot using URDF.

- URDF syntax and structure
- Coordinate frames and transforms
- Links and joints
- Visualizing robots in RViz
- Sensor integration

## ⏱️ Time Commitment

**Estimated completion time**: 8-12 hours

This includes reading, understanding concepts, and running all code examples.

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:

- **Python 3 basics**: Variables, functions, classes, imports
- **Linux command line**: Basic terminal navigation, running commands
- **Ubuntu 22.04** with **ROS 2 Humble** installed ([installation guide](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation.html))

:::tip Quick Setup Check

Verify your ROS 2 installation:

```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
ros2 --version
```

Expected output: `ros2 run humble`
