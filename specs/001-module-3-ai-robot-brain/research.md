# Research Findings: Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain Content

## No Specific Clarifications Identified

During the planning phase for Module 3, no critical ambiguities or underspecified areas were identified in the technical context that required dedicated research. All key technologies, platforms, and environments (NVIDIA Isaac platform, ROS 2, Docker, Jetson Orin Nano/NX, Ubuntu 22.04) were explicitly stated or clearly inferable from the feature description.

The architectural plan proceeds with the understanding that the specified environment and tools are to be directly utilized as outlined in the feature specification.
